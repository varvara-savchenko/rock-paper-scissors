hola amigos! ðŸ‘‹

as a part of self-studying, I've created a basic rock-paper-scissors game. I bet you know the rules! :) 

if you want to try it, just paste the code into some compiler (e.g. https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) and type the name of your weapon into the playGame field.
